# Project 1 Test Cases
These are some test cases for my CS201 class. There is also a make file to compile each test case or all of them together.
## Description of Test Cases
**Phase1Main** - Just a copy of the provided Phase1Main, slightly reformated and the expected value of foo fixed.
**LazyMainTest** - A copy of Phase1Main that will tell you if your CDA has correct values at certain checkpoints. (So you don't have to read as many numbers)

### Usage
To use just place the files with your CDA.cpp, you can then either manually compile each test or use the makefile included to compile.
