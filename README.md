# Project 1 Test Cases
These are some test cases for my CS201 class project. There is also a make file to compile each test case or all of them together.
## Description of Test Cases
**Phase1Main and LazyTestMain removed on 03/12/2021**
~~**Phase1Main** - Just a copy of the provided Phase1Main, slightly reformated and the expected value of foo fixed.  
**LazyTestMain** - A copy of Phase1Main that will tell you if your CDA has correct values at certain checkpoints. (So you don't have to read as many numbers)~~  
**RunTimeTestMain** - Tests the runtimes of the add and delete operations (this really only verifies that its not taking an extreme amount of time, I highly recommend you trace your code to verify your run times)  
**CDABreakMain** - Just a few irregular cases that could potentially break your CDA  

### Usage
To use just place the files with your CDA.cpp, you can then either manually compile each test or use the makefile included to compile. 
Use at least c++11 when compiling.
